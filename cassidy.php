    <h1>Cassidy Clayton</h1>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Cassidy Clayton, and I’m a senior majoring in Linguistics and minoring in Medieval and Early Modern Studies--the former of which might have some use in the future, the latter of which remains primarily an excuse to study archaic texts and feed my passion for folk and fairy tales, Robin Hood stories, and Arthurian legends.
    </p>

    <p>When I’m not working, dancing, or in class, you can find me climbing (rocks, usually, but sometimes trees), binge-watching something on Youtube or Netflix (Clone Wars or Critical Role), or curled up with a book (in all honestly, probably a re-read of the Throne of Glass series).
    </p>

    <p> I was born in Fruitland Park, a small town in central Florida, but after living there for 18 years, I was ready for cooler climes--and actual seasons. I toured Rochester while on a trip to visit my aunt, on a frosty, blustery day in March--and while I found much of the campus to be interesting and pleasant, it wasn’t until I had a chance to explore Rush Rhees that I decided I wanted to stay here. I got lost, you see, in the labyrinth of the stacks. I’d never gotten lost in a library before, and that, along with an antique book titled Celtic Dragon Myth that I found while wandering, grabbed at my heart and filled me with a deep sense that UR was most definitely the place for me. Once on campus, I joined several clubs over the course of the years, first trying (and later dropping) Quidditch, then picking up Linguistics Undergraduate Council, URSGA, and Sihir Bellydance Ensemble.
    </p>

    <p> As for courses, I’ve mostly completed my major requirements, and I’ve finished what I need for my minor as well. By getting most of those classes out of the way during my first two and a half years of school, I was able to do something completely different when studying abroad in Dublin during the spring of 2018. While there, I attended the “Business, Globalisation, and Entrepreneurship” program with IES Abroad. And while the required classes were enlightening and informative, my real favorites were the photography and immersion writing classes (‘immersion writing’ is a genre of creative nonfiction that includes things like blog posts, travel narratives, reviews, and opinion pieces).
      <p>

    <p> My goal beyond University is to move to Edmonton, Canada, to work there and eventually set up my own tea shop. I’ve quite a fondness for tea, you see, to the point of obsessive collecting, and at some point I’d like to be able to share that love of tea with the population at large.
      <p>

    <p> 	I currently work in Collections Development at the library, as well as freelancing as a proofreader, copywriter, and content manager. I do infinitely prefer my current positions to previous ones I have held, namely in movie theaters and as a hostess in restaurants catering to retirees. Oh, and also a brief stint as a nursery worker (trees, not babies) in the Florida heat. That adventure certainly gave me both an appreciation for folks who do make that their career and a firm opinion that I did not want to make it mine.
