    Taking Orgo in high school convinced me I wanted to work with Chemistry for the rest of my life, so I applied to way too many colleges as a Chemical Engineering major. Fast forward eight months, and I wound up at the University of Rochester. I took my introductory engineering courses and realized I did not want to be in a lab for the rest of my life. I did take a super interested Economics course, and changed my major to Business by the end of my freshman year. It was one of the better decisions Iâ€™ve made, but I still missed using the more computational part of my brain, so I decided to give Computer Science another shot (I had taken a few classes in high school), and turned that into a minor.
